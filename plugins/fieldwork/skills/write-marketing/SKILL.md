# Write Marketing Brief

## Overview

Produce ready-to-use marketing copy and asset briefs grounded in the GTM plan, spec, and product context. Not generic templates — actual draft copy the team can use or adapt. Written for marketing leads, content writers, and designers.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the Fieldwork write-marketing skill to produce marketing assets."

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT write marketing assets if:
- gtm-plan.md status is not `approved` — run write-gtm first
- context/product-context.md is missing or empty — run onboard first
</HARD-GATE>

## Pre-flight check

1. Load `outputs/gtm/{feature-name}/gtm-plan.md` — confirm `status: approved`. If not, stop.
2. Load `outputs/specs/{feature-name}/spec.md`.
3. Load `context/product-context.md` — read positioning, personas, channels, existing tone.
4. Load `context/project-context.md`.
5. If existing marketing copy is available in the codebase or docs, read it to match tone.
6. Create directory `outputs/gtm/{feature-name}/` if it does not exist (it should already).

## Copy principles

Apply to every asset:
- Lead with the user benefit, not the feature name
- Use the language from opportunity.md — how users describe the problem, not how engineers describe the solution
- Be specific — avoid "powerful", "seamless", "intuitive", "game-changing"
- One CTA per asset
- Match the product's existing tone (read existing copy if available)
- Reference personas from product-context.md — write for a specific person, not a generic user

## Asset menu

Present this list and ask which to produce. Do not produce all assets by default.

- [ ] **Email announcement** — subject line + body (existing customers)
- [ ] **In-app message** — tooltip, modal, or banner copy
- [ ] **Social posts** — LinkedIn + Twitter/X (3 variants each)
- [ ] **Blog post outline** — headline, subheads, key points, CTA
- [ ] **Sales one-pager** — what it is, who it's for, how to pitch it
- [ ] **Changelog entry** — short, user-facing release note
- [ ] **Press release outline** — if public launch

For each selected asset: draft it, present it, get approval, then move to the next. Do not batch all assets and present at the end.
